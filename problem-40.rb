#Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer,
#which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

#For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.

#Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.

  for i in arr
    # if hash[i]
    #   hash[i] = hash[i] + 1
    # else
    #   hash[i] = 1
    # end
    # ???? 
  end

arr1 = [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6]
arr2 = [13, 19, 13, 13]
