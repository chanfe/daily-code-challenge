State populations
SQL Database Querying Window Function
Suppose you come across a table containing 3 fields:

country name (country_name)
state name (state_name)
total population (total_population) #total population for a given state
Using this information, write a function in SQL that returns the following:

state_name | total_population | percent_of_country_population

Note the last field, percent_of_country_population, can be calculated by dividing
each individual state's population by the total population of its associated country in the table.


to create a table use this:
CREATE TABLE StatePopulations ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, country_name  VARCHAR(20), state_name VARCHAR(20), total_population INTEGER)

insert with this example:
INSERT INTO statepopulations (ID,country_name,state_name,total_population) VALUES (
  '1',
  'United States',
  'north carolina',
  '50'
);

to get the solution to this use this sql:
with total as
    ( select sum(total_population) as total
    from statepopulations )
SELECT country_name, state_name, (CAST(total_population as float) / cast(total.total as float)) * 100 as percent_of_country_population
from statepopulations, total
