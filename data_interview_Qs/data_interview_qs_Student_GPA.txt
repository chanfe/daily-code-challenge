Student GPA
SQL Database Querying
Provided the following tables, write a SQL query to pull the average GPA (grade_point in table) by subject for completed classes.


Table 1: student_classes

Column Name	    Data Type	Description
student_id	    integer	    id of the student
class_id	    integer	    will be a value between 0-12, which corresponds
subject	        string	    subject the class falls into
class_name	    string	    name of the class
complete	    boolean	    indicates if student has completed class

Table 2: student_grades

Column Name	    Data Type	Description
student_id	    integer	    id of the student
class_id	    integer	    id of class student is enrolled in
grade_point	    integer	    grade point achieved, between 0.0 - 4.0 with one decimal increments


my answer:

select subject, avg(grade_point)
from (SELECT *
FROM student_classes
inner join student_grade on student_grade.class_id = student_classes.class_id and student_grade.student_id = student_classes.student_id
where complete = TRUE) as class_grade
group by subject
